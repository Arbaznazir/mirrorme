## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Analysis Engine (`backend/ai_engine.py`)

#### 1. Timeline Analysis Method

```python
def analyze_algorithm_influence_timeline(self, behavior_logs, days_back=30):
    """Analyze how algorithms may be influencing user behavior over time."""
    # Groups behavior by day
    # Tracks political lean changes (left/right/neutral percentages)
    # Tracks sentiment changes (positive/negative/neutral percentages)
    # Detects polarization trends and emotional manipulation
```

#### 2. Algorithmic Influence Detection

```python
def _detect_algorithmic_influence(self, timeline_points, political_trend, sentiment_trend):
    """Detect patterns that suggest algorithmic influence or bias reinforcement."""
    # Bias Reinforcement Detection: Compares early vs recent political lean
    # Sentiment Manipulation Detection: Analyzes emotional volatility patterns
    # Echo Chamber Detection: Identifies topics with >40% concentration
    # Platform Bias Warnings: Detects platforms with >15% political skew
```

#### 3. Topic Bias Analysis

```python
def analyze_topic_bias_detection(self, behavior_logs, days_back=30):
    """Analyze what topics algorithms are pushing towards the user."""
    # Topic Exposure Analysis: Tracks what content you're seeing
    # Algorithmic Push Detection: Identifies topics with >20% exposure
    # Cross-Platform Coordination: Detects synchronized topic pushing
    # Sentiment/Political Bias per Topic: Shows how topics are framed
```

#### 4. Coordinated Topic Detection

```python
def _detect_coordinated_topic_pushing(self, platform_topic_bias):
    """Detect topics being pushed across multiple platforms simultaneously."""
    # Identifies topics appearing on 2+ platforms with suspiciously even distribution
    # Calculates coordination strength based on statistical variance
    # Warns users about potential orchestrated content campaigns
```
