# MirrorMe Logo Update Instructions

## To add your PNG logo:

1. **Save your PNG logo file** as `logo.png` in the `frontend/public/` directory
2. **Replace the placeholder** that's currently there
3. **Recommended logo specifications:**
   - Size: 512x512px or 256x256px for best quality
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - High resolution for crisp display on all devices

## Files that have been updated to use PNG logo:

- ✅ `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Main logo display
- ✅ `frontend/public/index.html` - Favicon and app icons
- ✅ Logo will display on the landing page
- ✅ Logo will appear as favicon in browser tab
- ✅ Logo will be used for mobile app icon

## To complete the logo integration:

```bash
# Copy your PNG logo file to the correct location
copy your-logo-file.png frontend/public/logo.png
```

Then restart the application with:

```bash
./start-mirrorme.bat
```

Your logo will then appear throughout the MirrorMe application!
